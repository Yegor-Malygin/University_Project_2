This Assignment was my first introduction to data structures and their implementation in prgrams using python, we were given a basic template and test cases to use.
we were meant to complete the functions in order to make a game of UNO work, we also had to choose what we considered to be the most optimal data structure for each variable
we were not allowed to use python's inbuilt lists and arrays, all other limits are also included in the README inside the Assignment1A folder

Completed for Unit FIT 1008 at Monash University in 2024
